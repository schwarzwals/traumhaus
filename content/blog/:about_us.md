Meet our Family.

Hi everyone, thank you for stopping by. If you ever wonder who we are, well here's a short about us.

A young family of four. I'm a photographer, my wife's a Chef(believe it or not) and our kids...well they are the reason we wake up in the morning...thank you kiddos.

We are living in a small town called Schutterwald in the south of Germany, surrounded by the Black Forest and the best wineries in this country.

We decided to build a house because...why paying off someone else's credit. Just kidding. Actually not. That was one of the reason too. A big one. 

So yeah, here we are. Full of debts for the next 30 years. But hey, we'are all in this together right ?
